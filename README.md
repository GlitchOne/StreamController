# StreamController
A custom DIY Stream Controller that can double as pretty much anything that needs buttons to operate.

## Disclaimer
The PCB design and the Source Code are meant to work only on the **Pololu A-Star 32u4 Mini** Microcontroller as that is what I had lying around when I first built the prototypes. On request, I could probably rebuild the PCB designs and source code to make them work with other controllers.

## Features
* Capable of recognizing a total of 16 buttons and 4 potentiometers (or 20 buttons, or any other combination with a max of 4 pots)
* Capable of sending keyboard and mouse inputs when coupled with microcontroller board that use the Atmel 32u4.
* Capable of lighting up 16 buttons together with a digital RGB strip using the Adafruit NeoPixel library.
